# idris-libsel4-ffi
An Idris FFI to the libsel4 library

# How to use this library?

See the instructions in the project repository, [sel4-idris-manifest](https://github.com/mokshasoft/sel4-idris-manifest).

# Configuration with [m4](https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/m4.html)

The Idris files in this repository are named .idr.m4. The m4 macro processor is used as a preprocessor for Idris files, much like #ifdef's for C. This is necessary because the autoconf.h file that is generated by the seL4 Kbuild system controls which functions that are included/excluded from the build.
